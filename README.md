## Oculus Switcher

All owners of Oculus VR helmets have come across the fact that a helmet connected to a running computer constantly works and heats up. This application is designed to put the helmet into standby mode, as if the computer is off.

The operation of the application is based on interaction with Windows services, in particular with the service responsible for the operation of Oculus helmets.
